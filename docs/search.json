Photo: Erik Kusch\n\n\nIn 2024, the Open Science course was held at Hjerkinn, located between Oslo and Trondheim. Everybody made their way slowly up the mountain. The journey from Oslo took an hour longer, because of a missing bridge and a “bus for tog” replacement. The weather at Hjerkinn was sunny and we entered a winter wonderland. Not only the beauty took away our breath, as the temperature was far below 0 °C. An we walked though deep snow to our accommodation.\nOur international students this year were from Scandinavia (Norway, and Denmark), and Europe and Asia (Belgium, Switzerland, Italy, and Thailand). This year one supervisor from a student that took the course last year attended the course to be able to keep up with their students. Also, a cat and a dog were part of the team.\nEvery day we quickly ran to out lecture room before freezing, as this required a few steps outside. The students were very interested and engaged and learned how to wrangle data, write code, execute functions, and even learned how to make a package. They learned about reproducible workflows, using tools to improve reproducibility in their own work, such as quarto, git/GitHub and targets. Also, they learned about GBIF, Darwin Core data standards and what it takes to meet the FAIR data standards. One evening we had a fun exercise, where we went through journals searching if the authors provided data and code for their studies and analysis. While the work was fun and the students did not want to stop, the results was disappointing, as we did not find a lot of data and code that was accessible. Mid week, we visited the Villreinsenter at Hjerkinn and afterwards hike through deep snow to a little top and had a deserved break.\nAfter five days, we left Hjerkinn tired and satisfied; full of ideas, motivation and newly aquired tools and skills to improve our work and workflows.\n\n\n\nManaging Ecological Data workshop, NØF 2023 (NMBU)\nWe organized a workshop at the NØF 2023 conference at NMBU on Managing ecological data: Best practices for data sharing and data reuse based on transparent and reproducible workflows. The aim of the workshop was to illustrate what data management is and why it is important. We showed best practice in managing ecological data for sharing your own data, applying FAIR principles, and for reusing existing datasets. The workshop included hands-on training tools for sharing data and making reproducible documents.\nThe workshop was aimed at ecologists that create and/or reuse ecological data from early career researchers with little experience with data management to more experienced researchers. The hands-on training will be based on selected case studies, and implemented in statistical program R.\nOrganized by Aud H. Halbritter (University of Bergen), Erlend B. Nilsen (Norwegian Institute for Nature Research and Nord University, and project leader of Living Norway Ecological Data Network) and Matt Grainger (Norwegian Institute for Nature Research).\n\n\nOS course 2022, Alpine Research Station Finse in Norway\n\n\n\nGroup of students and teacher at Open Science course in 2023 at Finse.

Fisher, the “inventor” of the \\(p\\)-value (1920s) didn’t mean the \\(p\\)-value to be used in the way it is used today, which is: doing a single experiment and use \\(p<0.05\\) for a conclusion.\n\\(~\\)\nFrom Goodman (2016):\n\\(~\\)\n\nFisher used “significance” merely to indicate that an observation was worth following up, with refutation of the null hypothesis justified only if further experiments “rarely failed” to achieve significance. This is in stark contrast to the modern practice of making claims based on a single demonstration of statistical significance.\n\n\\(~\\)"
