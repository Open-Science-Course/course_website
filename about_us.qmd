We are a group of ecologists, statisticians and everything in between, with interests in Open Science, reproducibility and transparency in Ecology.

I am a researcher in plant ecology at the University of Bergen (Norway) interested in global change impacts on alpine biodiversity and ecosystem functions. For the last eight years, I have been part of developing bioST\@TS, an online teaching and learning platform on data management and analysis for biology students. More recently, I have engaged in Open Science practice in my own research, supervision and teaching. I initiated and organize the Open Science Course in Ecology.

#### Matt Grainger

I am a researcher at NINA (Norwegian Institute for Nature Research) interested in evidence-based conservation and in metascience ("the science of science"). I am a part of the Living Norway Ecological Data Network and within that project focus on developing tools (e.g. R packages, Shiny Apps, etc.) and workflows to help researchers share their data openly and to make use of open data in their research. I am a member of the ESHackathon, an interdisciplinary community of practice making evidence-based decisions easier to achieve through opensource software, and SORTEE (Society for Open, Repeatable and Transparent Ecology and Evolution).

#### Dag Endresen

I am a professor at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences (NMBU) interested in evidence-based management and conservation of wildlife populations and ecosystems. I am a part of the Living Norway Ecological Data Network and engaged in implementing open science practices in teaching and supervision at the university, and in my own research.

#### Stefanie Muff

I am an Associate Professor in Statistics at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) in Trondheim, Norway. I am collaborating with biologists and ecologists on a regular basis and is therefore having an intrinsic interest in open and reproducible science.

I am a palaeoecologist at the University of Bergen (UiB), Norway. I am interested in quantitative palaeoecology, keen to make research in ecology and palaeoecology more reproducible and the organiser of R-klubben, a drop-in peer-to-peer R help session at the Department of Bioscience at UiB.
